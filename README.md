# Hi5ive App

 **Hi5ive** is a app used to promote encouragement inside of the classroom by sending classmates *"Virtual"* Hi5ives. Classmates can send eachother Hi5ives which notify them via the Twilio API. The Hi5ive is then rendered directly onto their homepage. The user can then choose to send them back a Hi5ive or send any other classmate a Hi5ive.
